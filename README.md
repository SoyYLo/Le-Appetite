# The-Music-Store

This is our backup project

## Description 

When I open the webpage I am presented with the name of the website. I am given a search input to enter the music genre I want. When the page loads with given data I am presented with a list of artists and playlists to view. When I click on the list I want I can view all the songs that fit with the genre I chose. I can click on a link so that i can listen to that playlist or artist.
